## Design Ideas

I wanted the UI to be clean and basic, to not distract from the colors in the palettes.

Color palettes are generated as the user manipulates diffrent sliders. All palettes have 5 diffrent colors. The first color in the pallet is the "key color" AKA the direct output of the sliders. Only 1-3 colors in each palette have a diffrent hue, the other colors only vary in saturation and lightness. The hue variations are based in color theory relationships(analogus, complementary, split complementary, etc.).
